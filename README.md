# Machine Learning Engineer Nanodegree (Udacity) - 2020

This repository contains the projects I completed as part of the **Machine Learning Engineer Nanodegree** program at **Udacity** in 2020. The projects showcase my skills and understanding of machine learning techniques, cloud computing, and model deployment. 

## Projects Overview

### 1. [Sentiment Analysis Model Deployment](#project-1-deploy-a-sentiment-analysis-model-using-aws-sagemaker)
- **Objective**: Deploy a sentiment analysis model that can classify text into positive or negative sentiment.
- **Tools & Technologies**: AWS SageMaker, BeautifulSoup, PyTorch, AWS Lambda, AWS API Gateway, AWS Endpoints.

### 2. [Plagiarism Detection System](#project-2-plagiarism-detector-using-aws-sagemaker)
- **Objective**: Build and deploy a plagiarism detection model that identifies similarities between documents.
- **Tools & Technologies**: AWS SageMaker, PyTorch, AWS Lambda, AWS API Gateway, AWS Endpoints.

### 3. [Capstone Project: Predicting Life Expectancy](#capstone-project-predicting-life-expectancy-rate-of-a-country)
- **Objective**: Build a model that predicts the life expectancy rate of a country based on various socio-economic indicators.
- **Tools & Technologies**: IBM Cloud, IBM Watson, Node-RED Flow Editor.

## Requirements

- **Project 1 & 2**:
  - AWS SageMaker
  - BeautifulSoup
  - PyTorch
  - AWS Lambda
  - AWS API Gateway
  - AWS Endpoints
  
- **Capstone Project**:

## Installation & Setup

To get started with the projects, follow these steps:

1. Clone this repository to your local machine:
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/samarasimhapeyala/Udacity-MLEngineer-Nanodegree.git
   ```

2. Navigate to each project directory and follow the specific setup instructions in the respective `README` file within each project folder.

## Project Details

### Project 1: Deploy a Sentiment Analysis Model using AWS SageMaker
This project involves training a sentiment analysis model and deploying it using AWS SageMaker. The model takes text as input and classifies it as positive or negative. The model is then made accessible via a REST API using AWS Lambda and API Gateway.

### Project 2: Plagiarism Detector using AWS SageMaker
In this project, a plagiarism detection system is built using a machine learning model trained on text similarity features. The model is deployed using AWS SageMaker, with the REST API also built on AWS Lambda and API Gateway to serve predictions.

### Capstone Project: Predicting Life Expectancy Rate of a Country
For the capstone project, a model is developed to predict the life expectancy of countries based on socio-economic factors, such as GDP, healthcare access, and education level. The project makes use of IBM Cloud services, IBM Watson, and the Node-RED flow editor for model deployment and integration.
